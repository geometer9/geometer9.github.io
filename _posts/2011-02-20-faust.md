I will be performing a new original soundtrack for the 1926 silent film _Faust_ (directed by F.W. Murnau of _Nosferatu_ fame). The performance will take place at the German Cultural Center at Colony Square in Atlanta on March 5th.

The music will consist of pre-recorded electronic music, with guitar performed live.

The performance is free.
