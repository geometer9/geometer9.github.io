I’m not ready to reveal all of the details yet (and some details are not yet settled, like publication date), but I will have a book – my first! – coming out sometime in 2018.

The book will cover the history and practice of angular magic – a unique approach to magic pioneered by Anton LaVey and further developed by Michael Aquino, Stephen Flowers, and others. Angular magic takes influence from the fiction of H.P. Lovecraft and related writers, the “Command to Look” of photographer William Mortensen, the number mysticism of Pythagoras, and their manifestations through Anton LaVey’s Law of the Trapezoid. These ideas and techniques have continued to be refined through the work of the Order of the Trapezoid in the Temple of Set, even though they have rarely been publicly discussed until now.

This will be published by a major publisher of high quality, scholarly esoteric books, which I’ll reveal once the info is available on their website (the contract has already been signed, the fully marked up manuscript has been submitted, etc. so it’s official and definitely happening, but just not ready to announce).
