# Contact

The most common question received by the Marshall of the Order of the Trapezoid is:

## Where can I get more information?

The following books are recommended for further information on the philosophy and practices that underpin the Order of the Trapezoid:

* *Uncle Setnakt's Essential Guide to the Left-Hand Path*
* *Lords of the Left-Hand Path*
* *Mysteries of the Temple of Set*

The above books can be ordered from [Lodestar](http://seekthemystery.com/left-hand-path){:target="_blank"}, the successor imprint to the renowned R&ucirc;na-Raven Press.

Additionally, Volume I of [The Temple of Set](http://www.amazon.com/Temple-Set-I-1/dp/1497567459), by Grandmaster Emeritus Sir Michael Aquino, contains a lengthy and detailed chapter on the reconsecration of the Order and its early history.

The second most common question received by our Marshall is:

## How do I join?

Our requirements are rigorous. To become a Knight of our Order, it is first necessary to undergo philosophic and initiatory training within the [Temple of Set](http://www.xeper.org){:target="_blank"} and attain the degree of Adept.

You must then find a potential sponsor. This is a member of the Priesthood of Set who is also a Knight of the Order of the Trapezoid. If, after a period of testing and evaluation, the Knight chooses to extend sponsorship to you, you will have to appear before a Lodgemaster or a Master of the Trapezoid to take the Oath of the Order.

More information can be found on the [Qualifications](/mission/qualifications.html) page.

## How can I contact you?

The preferred method of contact is via the Temple of Set's main office (see [www.xeper.org](http://www.xeper.org){:target="_blank"}). Direct inquiry with the Grandmaster can be made via [email](mailto:saturnin@fastmail.fm).
