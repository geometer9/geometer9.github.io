On July 2, the new Misdreamt CD, _Apophenia -or- The Final Static That Can Never Be Removed_, will be released digitally (via Bandcamp), and in a limited edition hand-drawn CD version. There will be a more widely available physical release soon after.

There is a personal significance for July 2, important to reconciling patterns in my own life, that I will not go into here.  But, while researching other events that took place on that date, the following came to light:

- July 2, 1897: Guglielmo Marconi receives a patent for radio.  While Nikola Tesla is later retroactively acknowledged as radio's inventor (primarily due to the fact that Marconi's work was critically dependent on more than a dozen patents that Tesla held), Marconi received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work.  Radio receivers are one way that Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) can be recorded, and EVP plays a major role in this Misdreamt release.

- July 2, 1877: Author Hermann Hesse is born.  Hesse's novel _The Glass Bead Game_ (cited in his 1948 award of the Nobel Prize for Literature) is a notable among other things for its titular Game, a means of reconciling seeming disparate fields of knowledge, and finding the patterns that tie them together in both individuals and in the greater stream of history.

- July 2, 1566: Nostradamus dies. Predictions and prognostications, where they have any validity at all, are an expert reading of the patterns that shape events. That being said, it is much easier to predict retroactively than it is in advance.  As Umberto Eco wrote in _Foucault's Pendulum_, "Any fact becomes important when it is connected to another."

The track listing for _Apophenia_ will be as follows:

1. The Weight of Dreams Against the Harsh Wisdom of the World (part I)
2. The Weight of Dreams ... (part II)
3. The Weight of Dreams ... (part III)
4. The Weight of Dreams ... (part IV)
5. Where Whispers Stayed Forever
6. Contemplation of the Dust
7. Diving Into the Stars
8. Shadows Remain (part I)
9. Shadows Remain (part II)
