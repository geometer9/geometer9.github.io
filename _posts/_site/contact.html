<p>The most common question received by the Marshall of the Order of the Trapezoid is:</p>

<h2 id="where-can-i-get-more-information">Where can I get more information?</h2>

<p>The following books are recommended for further information on the philosophy and practices that underpin the Order of the Trapezoid:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Uncle Setnakt’s Essential Guide to the Left-Hand Path</em></li>
  <li><em>Lords of the Left-Hand Path</em></li>
  <li><em>Mysteries of the Temple of Set</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The above books can be ordered from <a href="http://seekthemystery.com/left-hand-path" target="_blank">Lodestar</a>, the successor imprint to the renowned Rûna-Raven Press.</p>

<p>Additionally, Volume I of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Temple-Set-I-1/dp/1497567459">The Temple of Set</a>, by Grandmaster Emeritus Sir Michael Aquino, contains a lengthy and detailed chapter on the reconsecration of the Order and its early history.</p>

<p>The second most common question received by our Marshall is:</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-join">How do I join?</h2>

<p>Our requirements are rigorous. To become a Knight of our Order, it is first necessary to undergo philosophic and initiatory training within the <a href="http://www.xeper.org" target="_blank">Temple of Set</a> and attain the degree of Adept.</p>

<p>You must then find a potential sponsor. This is a member of the Priesthood of Set who is also a Knight of the Order of the Trapezoid. If, after a period of testing and evaluation, the Knight chooses to extend sponsorship to you, you will have to appear before a Lodgemaster or a Master of the Trapezoid to take the Oath of the Order.</p>

<p>More information can be found on the <a href="/mission/qualifications.html">Qualifications</a> page.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-contact-you">How can I contact you?</h2>

<p>The preferred method of contact is via the Temple of Set’s main office (see <a href="http://www.xeper.org" target="_blank">www.xeper.org</a>). Direct inquiry with the Grandmaster can be made via <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#115;&#097;&#116;&#117;&#114;&#110;&#105;&#110;&#064;&#102;&#097;&#115;&#116;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#102;&#109;">email</a>.</p>
