# Mission

The Order of the Trapezoid is a chivalric Order of Knighthood dedicated to the Prince of Darkness and protection of the _**Black Flame**_.

In order to learn more about what the Order of the Trapezoid is and does, these resources reveal something of the sense of _**R&ucirc;na**_ (i.e., the essence of the Mysterious) that lurks hidden within.

* The [Order statement](/mission/statement.html) tells much of the Order's purpose and history, through to the form it takes today.

* All endeavors within the Order share [four elements](/mission/mysteries.html) which are central to our Work.

* The [methods and organization](/mission/methods.html) of the Order describe the framework that connects the Grail Quest of the individual Knight or Dame to the Quest embodied by the Order itself.

* Entry into the Order is held to the highest of standards, subject to certain [core qualifications](/mission/qualifications.html).
