The new Misdreamt CD is now available!

_Apophenia_ is based on manipulated sounds (static, voices, field recordings) combined with minimalist guitar and percussion.

> "Any fact becomes important when it is connected to another." - Umberto Eco

All sentient beings look for patterns in their environment; when the mind looks too deeply into phenomena that otherwise have no meaning, it can project voices onto static, a face onto the surface of Mars, or its innermost fears onto an otherwise random collection of ink blots. The line between meaning and nothingness is as fleeting as our own self-awareness.
