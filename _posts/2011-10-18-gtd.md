> The truth is, our energy as human beings seems to have a dualistic and teleological realityâ€”we create and identify with things that aren't real yet on all the levels we experience; and when we do, we recognize how to restructure our current world to morph it into the new one, and experience an impetus to make it so.

David Allen, _Getting Things Done_
