"The Bone Season" will be part of a sound diffusion recital by <a target="_blank" href="https://adamscottneal.com/">Adam Scott Neal</a> at the __Sonic Arts Research Center__ in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The audience will be completed enveloped by the vast 40.6 surround sound system, and some may even live to tell about it.
