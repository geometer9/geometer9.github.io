title: Infernal Geometry - bibliography notes
layout: page
---


When I originally prepared the bibliography for _Infernal Geometry and the Left-Hand Path_, I included notes about many of the works explaining their significance to Angular Magic and the book in general. I find this sort of annotation to be useful, because many times it's not obvious why a particular book is cited, or easy to determine which other books should be more or less important to read as supplementary material.  The Temple of Set's reading list (an older version of which can be found Dr. Aquino's two volume set _The Temple of Set_) gives short descriptions of all works along with a ranking to help readers determine their relative interest for a given work.  I have found that immensely helpful, and wanted to apply it in some fashion to this bibliography.

The bibliographical format the Inner Traditions uses as its house style does not support this type of annotation, unfortunately. They did find the additional info very useful and interesting, and suggested that I turn it into a blog post at some point. Which I'm doing now.

I'm leaving out notes on works that are only available within the archives of the Temple of Set or the Order of the Trapezoid, as members of both of those bodies will know how to find them and will likely immediately understand why they were included.

### Works by (Open) Members of the Temple of Set

#### Stephen Flowers / Edred Thorsson

1. **_Runes and Magic_**, Chapter 2; Rûna-Raven/Lode Star, 1986 and later editions. (*This chapter from Dr. Flower's Ph.D. dissertation provides a detailed academic treatment of the semiotic theory of magic*)

1. **_Runelore_**, Chapter 6 ("Historical Rune Magic and Divination"); Weiser, 1987. (*This chapter focuses on semiotics and divination, in the context of the Runes but easily applicable to other semiotic systems such as the Nine Angles*)

1. **_Lords of the Left Hand Path_**; Rûna-Raven (1992, 1997), then revised further for Inner Traditions (2012). (*The chapters on the Church of Satan and Temple of Set provide and interpret vital information for understanding the significance of these organizations in modern occulture*)

#### Don Webb

1. **"Fictive Arcanum"**, original date unknown. (Available on the Order of the Trapezoid's website, and as "Why Do Magicians Write Fiction?" in _Uncle Setnakt's Nightbook_ (Lode Star, 2016) (*An examination of the semiotic theory in the context of fiction that suggests effective frames of reference for magical work, whether or not the authors were practicing magicians*)

1. **_Uncle Setnakt's Essential Guide to the Left Hand Path_**; Rûna-Raven, 1999. (*An essential work for understanding the Left Hand Path in a manner not tied to any particular tradition; also includes the first publicly available hints about work with the Nine Angles since Dr. Aquino's article in _Nyctalops_ in 1977*)

#### Patty Hardy

1. **"Keystone"**, 1992. (*The mathematical relationships encoded in the Nine Angles and the Seal of Rûna provide a map by which the psyche can come to know itself in their reflection; appearing as Appendix D in this volume*)

1. **Dunn, Patrick. _Magic, Power, Language, Symbol: A Magician's Exploration of Linguistics_**. Llewelyn, 2008. (*Dunn is a professor of linguistics, as well as a practicing postmodern magician, and examines both of those disciplines from the point of view of the other resulting in insights and techniques that work well with the semiotic theory of magic as discussed in Chapter Five of this book.*)

See also Stephen Wolfram's __A New Kind of Science__ for a related approach that is more specifically related to the transition between the First and Second Angles.*) 

1. **Lawlor, Robert. _Sacred Geometry: Philosophy and Practice_**, Thames & Hudson, 1982. (*A wonderful review of basic geometric principles expressed through sacred geometry, with exercises and diagrams to illustrate the principles in practice rather than just an intellectual curiosity.*)

1. **Livio, Mario. _The Golden Ratio: The Story of PHI, the World's Most Astonishing Number_**. Broadway Books 2003. (*Spends as much time debunking fanciful -- and oft-repeated -- notions about the Golden Ratio as it does revealing the number's true wonder and mystery*)

1. **Mortensen, William. _The Command to Look: A Master Photographer’s Method for Controlling the Human Gaze_**, Feral House, 2014.

Éditions Gallimard, 1960; published in English in the U.S. by Stein and Day, 1964. (*One of Anton LaVey's most essential sources, though rarely acknowledged. This book is more or less responsible for the occult revival in the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s*).

1. **Rucker, Rudy. _The Fourth Dimension_**. Houghton Mifflin, 1984. (*A seminal influence on the early development of the Nine Angles as a magical system following Dr. Stephen Flowers' writings ca. 1988-1992. In a curious connection to key philosophical influences within the Temple of Set, Rucker is the great-great-great-grandson of the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.*)

(*In the appendix "The Sources of the System," Webb traces the origin of many of Gurdjieff's teachings on the Enneagram back to their likely origins in medieval philosophers such as Athanasius Kircher and Ramon Llull. The magical implications of studying precise geometric symbols and their inner meaning are discussed in detail, even as Gurdjieff himself would not consider his system to be a magical one.*)

### Films

* * *

1. _**Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari**_, 1920. (*As the most well-known of the German Expressionist films utilizing "strange angles" as a central feature of its set design, the disorienting appearance of virtually every scene in the film was a foundational influence on the formulation of the Law of the Trapezoid*.)

1. _**Metropolis**_, 1927. (*The most expensive film produced to that point, with cutting edge visual aesthetics and special effects, the futuristic dystopia _Metropolis_ gave the "mad labs" legacy of German occultism a stunning representation on the big screen. A seminal reference for the chamber design and mechanics of __Die Elektrischen Vorspiele__.*)

1. _**The Seventh Victim**_, 1943. (*A group of well-heeled, cosmopolitan people in New York City are in actuality members of a Satanic cult whose symbol and _mandala_ is a parallelogram. A significant source for Anton LaVey's "ideal" Satanists as well as for crucial ideas in his conception of the original Order of the Trapezoid*.)

1. _**Donald in Mathmagic Land**_, 1959. (*A remnant of a different time in terms of what was considered essential education; this half-hour Disney cartoon conveys a wealth of information about sacred geometry, Pythagoras, and related topics that are a fun -- and informative -- complement to this book near 60 years later. Easily found on YouTube*)

1. _**Satanis: The Devil's Mass**_, 1970. (*A documentary on the early days of the Church of Satan, featuring revealing conversations with LaVey, early Church members, and his neighbors. The interviews with LaVey reinforce the conviction and sincerity behind the founding of the Church and his role as High Priest*)

1. _**Asylum of Satan**_, 1972. (*A terribly conceived and produced film, with amazing ritual sequences courtesy of Michael Aquino. Included here solely for historical reasons, as the film represented the first appearance of the Nine Angles outside __The Satanic Rituals__*)

1. _**The Call of Cthulhu**_, 2005. (*A magnificent film of a story that on its surface seems unfilmable. The sequences in R'yleh -- where Cthulhu lay dead but dreaming before rising from his slumber -- impressively utilize strange angles created almost entirely without computer-generated effects. The H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society produced the film, and bring keen attention to detail along with a deep understanding of what makes the source material so compelling*.)
