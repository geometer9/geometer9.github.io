After a long period of silence since the announcement of its Remanifestation, the first Eyes of Ligeia release in 9 years is finally released!

Continuing in the style of 2004's _What the Moon Brings_, 2015's _The Sidereal Messenger_ continues with the themes of Starry Wisdom, the influence of H.P. Lovecraft, and an updated take on the same ethereal atmosphere that Doom-Metal.com called the "brooding sounds of decay and eternal night".

Track Listing:

1. Coruscations of the Daemon-Light (10:43)
2. The Going Forth of Sothis (13:40)
3. The Sidereal Messenger (09:59)
4. Through Angles Mirrored With Thoughts (12:58)
5. Descending Node Incantation (07:52)
