# Thought

In the more than three decades since the Order's consecration, many of its members and leaders have reflected on its philosophical and metaphysical underpinnings.  Here can be found a selection of publicly available writings that illuminate some facet of the Order's Mysteries.

* Persons of a certain level of Being can utter words of power&mdash;words that can cause others to do and feel things&mdash;words that can open into worlds. One such word is [Walhalla](/thought/walhalla-word.html), the watchword of the current manifestation of the Order of the Trapezoid.

* Aspects of the Order's Work with neo-mythology, especially that inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, are explored in the essay ["When the Stars Come Right Again"](/thought/when.html).

* _**The Ceremony of the Nine Angles**_ written by Michael Aquino and featured in Anton LaVey's _**The Satanic Rituals**_, is the foundation for the Order's work with angular magic. Dr. Aquino's essay ["Commentary on the Seal of the Nine Angles"](/thought/commentary.html) gives some of the background and initial impetus behind this powerful magical system.

* The magician's need for creating and utilizing fiction is explained through the semiotic theory of magic in Sir Don Webb's ["Fictive Arcanum"](/thought/arcanum.html).

* The [motto](/thought/walhalla.html) of the Order, **Walhalla!**, embodies a dynamic state of perpetual, self-aware existence that all Knights and Dames of the Order strive toward.

* There was a strong Germanic element to many of the early rituals of the Church of Satan, and this aesthetic was crystalized within the Order of the Trapezoid. Connections to this root of the deep past of the European _**psyche**_ can be found in ["The Secret of the Gothick God of Darkness"](/thought/secret.html).

* The [necessity of both the Left Hand and Right Hand Paths](/thought/two-paths.html) in a functional, healthy society is elaborated on by Dr. Stephen Flowers in an essay from his [_R&ucirc;narm&acirc;l-II_](http://www.seekthemystery.com){:target="_blank"} collection. 

* Just as the conception of the Order itself evolved prior to manifesting its present form in 1982, [so did its Seal](/thought/evolution.html).
