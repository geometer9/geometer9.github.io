I've had a lifelong fascination with the esoteric and the strange, and these days that interest is mainly centered around the northern Germanic treatment of these topics with a focus on the runes. I also work with semiotics and language as magical tools, and also work with the treatments of the mysterious and the unknown in the stories of authors like Fritz Leiber, Stefan Grabinski, and H.P. Lovecraft.

Over the past several years I have <a href="/appearances.html">lectured publicly</a> on varied topics such as Starry Wisdom and the Left Hand Path, the runes, and the history and practice of angular magic (with a focus on its history and development with the early Church of Satan and the Temple of Set).

<P>
I've also appeared on numerous <a href="/podcasts.html">postcasts</a>, discussing the above topics and much more.

Since 1999, I have been recording and releasing music as <a target="_blank" href="https://eyesofligeia.bandcamp.com">Eyes of Ligeia</a>, with most of the music (since 2004 at least) best described as doom metal-influenced ambient. My other main musical project is <a target="_blank" href="https://misdreamt.bandcamp.com">Misdreamt</a>, based on manipulated field recordings and other electro-acoustic sound. See <a href="/music.html">Music</a> for more info on these and other projects.
