I've been on a number of podcasts over the years, not all of which are still online. Here is but a sample of these appearances, hitting some of the highlights of the different topics I've touched on.

### Daimonosophy 2.0

My good friend Paul Fredric has hosted me on his podcast <a target="_blank" href="https://www.daimonosophy.com/">Daimonosophy 2.0: Fighting for Liberty and the Left-Hand Parth</a> multiple times. Paul covers a __WIDE__ range of subjects, with speakers from all corners of the magical and esoteric world.
